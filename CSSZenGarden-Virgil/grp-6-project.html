  <h1>Group Six CSS Zen Garden Project</h1>

  <p>Group members: Cindi Nichols, Charleson Otubu and Virgil Cane</p>

  <p>Our group's project theme will be outer space. The theme will be incorporated into the webpage through the color palette, fonts, and SVG images. </p>

  <p>Two wireframes were created using wireframe.cc web application. The <a href="https://wireframe.cc/QqDzoz" target="_blank">large wireframe</a> was created to describe the layout of the webpage on a standard labtop monitor. The <a href="https://wireframe.cc/uCIJWK" target="_blank">small wireframe</a> was created to describe the layout of the webpage on a phone.</p>
