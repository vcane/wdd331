1. The second <p> of the second <fieldset> could be selected by either of these selectors below. Explain why the first would be a better option than the second.

 A. fieldset[title=fieldset2] > p + p

 B. fieldset:nth-of-type(2) >p + p

#1 answer: Selector A is a better option than selector B because the attribute selector targets the element with that exact attribute value. No matter where that fieldset with paragraphs is located, it will be targeted. For example, if selector B was used, then a new fieldset and it became the second fieldset, the original second fieldset with its paragraphs would no longer be targeted by the selector.

2. Explain the difference the space makes with the following two selectors: "span.help" and "span .help". How does it change what will be selected?

#2 answer: The space in "span .help" makes this selector a Descendant Combinator. The "span .help" selector is targeting every element that is a descendant of a span element with the class attribute of help. The "span.help" selector is a span element with class attribute of help. The "span.help" selector will target any span element with a class attribute of help no matter where the span is located in the HTML.

  content: "(";
}

  content: ")";
}

fieldset p:nth-of-type(n + 3) {
  display: none;
}
